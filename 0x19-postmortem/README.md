# Postmortem: Web Server Outage - October 16, 2023

### Issue Summary:

- Duration: The outage occurred from 09:45 AM to 12:30 PM (UTC).
- Impact: The outage affected our primary web service, resulting in a 2 hour and 45-minute downtime, impacting approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced slow loading times and intermittent errors during the outage.

### Timeline:

- 09:45 AM (UTC): Issue Detected
  - The issue was detected when our monitoring system triggered a critical alert for increased server response times and a surge in error rates.

- 09:50 AM (UTC): Investigation Begins
  - The on-call engineer, Jane, started the investigation by checking the server logs and system metrics to identify the root cause.

- 10:15 AM (UTC): Assumption on Root Cause
  - Initial assumptions suggested a network issue as there were network-related errors in the logs. The network team was alerted to investigate further.

- 10:30 AM (UTC): Misleading Investigation
  - The network team's investigation did not reveal any network issues. This led to a brief period of confusion as the root cause remained unclear.

- 10:45 AM (UTC): Escalation
  - Frustrated by the lack of progress, Jane escalated the incident to the senior DevOps team for additional expertise.

- 11:15 AM (UTC): Resolution
  - The senior DevOps team identified the root cause as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing uneven distribution of traffic to web servers.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

- Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer. It was routing the majority of traffic to a single backend server, causing it to be overwhelmed while leaving others underutilized.

- Resolution: The issue was fixed by reconfiguring the load balancer to evenly distribute incoming traffic to all backend servers. This rebalancing was carried out gradually to avoid further service disruptions.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Regular load balancer configuration audits and testing to prevent misconfigurations.
  - Improved monitoring to detect uneven traffic distribution more promptly.

- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations and implement best practices.
  - Implement automated checks to ensure even traffic distribution.
  - Enhance monitoring with real-time alerts for sudden traffic imbalances.
  - Establish a clear incident escalation path for quicker response to complex issues.

In conclusion, the web server outage on October 16, 2023, was caused by a load balancer misconfiguration that resulted in slow performance and errors for approximately 30% of our users. The incident was detected promptly, though initial investigations led down misleading paths. It was ultimately resolved by the senior DevOps team by reconfiguring the load balancer. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will implement a series of corrective measures, including regular load balancer audits and improved monitoring, and we have specific tasks in place to address these issues.
